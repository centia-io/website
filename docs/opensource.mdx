# Open Source

Centia.io is licensed under AGPLv3 and is derived from the [Geocloud2 project](https://github.com/mapcentia/geocloud2).

## Cloud vs self-hosting

- Choose Centia Cloud if you want managed operations and the fastest path to shipping.
- Choose self-hosting if you need full control of runtime, networking, compliance boundaries, or local/offline environments.

Create a managed backend here: [/console](/console)

## Self-host with Docker

For self-hosting (local testing, staging, or production), use the official Docker deployment:

- Repository: [centia-io/centia-docker](https://github.com/centia-io/centia-docker)
- Follow the setup in that repository to bootstrap services and run Centia in your own environment.
