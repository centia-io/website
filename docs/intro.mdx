# Intro

Centia.io is a Backend as a Service (BaaS) that gives you a production‑ready backend — data, auth, realtime, and tooling — so you can focus on building great apps instead of maintaining servers.

## What you get

- Data you model the way you want
  - Define schemas, tables, columns, and constraints using the CLI. See Getting started to create your first schema and table. [Read the guide →](./start)
- Realtime APIs
  - Stream changes to your data to build live dashboards, chats, and collaborative UIs. [Learn about realtime →](./realtime)
- Client SDKs
  - Connect from web or server code with OAuth clients. [See SDKs →](./sdk) • [Clients →](./clients)
- Authentication and OAuth
  - Authenticate users and integrate identity providers. [OAuth overview →](./oauth)
- Objects and files
  - Store and serve files alongside your data. [Objects →](./objects)
- Open, developer‑first tooling
  - A simple CLI and familiar SQL workflows that fit into your existing toolchain. [Open source →](./opensource)

## How you’ll build with Centia

1) Create a backend in the console and sign in: [Open console](/console)
2) Model your data with the CLI (schemas, tables, columns). [Follow Getting started →](./start)
3) Connect your app with the SDK and start reading/writing data. [SDK →](./sdk)
4) Add realtime subscriptions where your UI needs to react instantly. [Realtime →](./realtime)
5) Secure access with OAuth and enforce rules per user or role. [OAuth →](./oauth) • [Rules →](./rules)
6) Ship. Your frontend can be deployed anywhere; Centia.io runs and scales the backend for you.

## When to use Centia

Use Centia when you want to:
- Ship quickly without building auth, data APIs, and realtime from scratch.
- Keep full control over your data model and query with SQL.
- Build reactive experiences (e.g., live dashboards, chats, collaborative apps).
