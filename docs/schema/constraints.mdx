#  Constraints

Data types are a way to limit the kind of data that can be stored in a table. For many applications, however, the constraint they provide is too coarse. For example, a column containing a product price should probably only accept positive values. But there is no standard data type that accepts only positive numbers. Another issue is that you might want to constrain column data with respect to other columns or rows. For example, in a table containing product information, there should be only one row for each product number.

## Add constraint

A constraint can be of either type primary|unique|foreign|check.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="http" label="HTTP">

        ```http title="Create a unique constraint on one column"
        POST https://api.centia.io/api/v4/schemas/rockhall/tables/inductees/constraints HTTP/1.1
        Content-Type: application/json
        Authorization: Bearer abc123

        {
            "name": "inductees-id-primary",
            "constraint": "primary",
            "columns": ["id"]
        }
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

        ```bash
        centia constraint add "rockhall" "inductees" "id" unique "inductees-id-primary"
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Get constraint

You can either get a single constraint or a collection of constraints.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="http" label="HTTP" default>

        ```http title="All constraints for a table"
        GET https://api.centia.io/api/v4/schemas/rockhall/tables/inductees/constraints HTTP/1.1
        Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8
        Authorization: Bearer abc123
        ```

        ```http title="Specific constraints by name"
        GET https://api.centia.io/api/v4/schemas/rockhall/tables/inductees/constraints/inductees-id-primary  HTTP/1.1
        Accept: application/json; charset=utf-8
        Authorization: Bearer abc123
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

        ```bash
        centia constraint get "rockhall" "inductees" "inductees-id-primary"
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

An index object looks like this.

```json
{
  "name": "inductees-id-primary",
  "constraint": "unique",
  "columns": ["id"]
}
```

## Delete constraint

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="http" label="HTTP" default>

        ```http title="Delete constraint by name"
        DELETE https://api.centia.io/api/v4/schemas/rockhall/tables/inductees/constraints/inductees-id-primary HTTP/1.1
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

        ```bash title="Delete constraint by name"
        centia constraint drop "rockhall" "inductees" "inductees-id-primary"
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
